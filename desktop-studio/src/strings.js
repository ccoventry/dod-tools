// strings.js
//
// Single centralized source for every user-facing English string in the
// desktop-studio frontend. NOT an i18n system — no language switching, no
// key-based lookup abstraction beyond plain named constants/functions. The
// point is purely "one place to find/edit any UI string."
//
// Grouped by pane/feature area for readability. Static strings are plain
// values; strings built from a template/interpolation are functions that
// return the built string (keeps the interpolation logic here, not
// scattered across the pane files).
//
// Rust backend error strings (src-tauri/) and console.log/console.error
// developer diagnostics are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE and are not represented
// here — only text actually shown to the end user.
