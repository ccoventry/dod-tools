//! Detects weapon-fire events that a recording *dropped*, using only that
//! recording -- no second demo to compare against.
//!
//! An automatic weapon fires at a fixed cyclic rate, so within a held burst
//! the gap between consecutive events is that rate. If a recording loses
//! rounds, the surviving gaps land on near-exact integer multiples of it. A
//! human releasing and re-pressing the trigger produces gaps too, but has no
//! reason to land on an exact multiple -- so "gap is within tolerance of n
//! times the cyclic rate, n >= 2" separates dropped rounds from deliberate
//! pauses.
//!
//! The cyclic rate is measured from the demo itself (the modal gap for that
//! weapon), so there is no hardcoded weapon table and it adapts to whatever
//! rate the recording actually ran at.
//!
//! Events are grouped per (weapon, shooter), because two players firing the
//! same weapon interleave into one stream otherwise and manufacture gaps that
//! were never one player's burst.
//!
//! **Validating the heuristic:** run it on a POV demo. Those record their own
//! player's fire essentially completely, so whatever this reports there is the
//! false-positive rate -- pauses being misread as drops. Compare that against
//! what it reports for an HLTV demo of the same match.
