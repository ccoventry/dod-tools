//! Rebuild the client's entity table at a join by injecting a synthetic full
//! snapshot (#224, and the remaining jank in #15).
//!
//! A stitched demo plays, but the engine prints `WARNING: CL_FlushEntityPacket`
//! and world objects -- crates, doors, props -- go missing. The tail's deltas
//! describe changes to an entity table the client never built, so it discards
//! whole packets rather than applying them. Players keep moving because they are
//! re-sent constantly with absolute origins; a static crate gets one update,
//! dropped, and is never corrected.
//!
//! The fix is to give the client a complete table at the cut. This replays every
//! entity update in the prefix -- seeded from entry 0's `SvcSpawnBaseline`, so a
//! field set only at spawn and genuinely never resent survives too -- merging
//! each entity's fields into one accumulated state, and writes that out as a
//! full `SvcPacketEntities` at the join -- the message type the demo otherwise
//! only contains at t=0.
//!
//! **Two live-crash fixes are baked into how that packet is encoded**, both
//! found by testing in-engine rather than by offline checks (which all still
//! pass on the broken versions): entity 0 is dropped from the list entirely
//! rather than restated, and its entities are encoded with increment/difference
//! indexing rather than absolute, matching what real `SvcPacketEntities`
//! traffic actually does. See the comment just above where the snapshot is
//! built for the measurements behind both.
