//! What the capture scanner would find in an HLTV demo, if it were allowed to
//! look.
//!
//! `native/src/patch/scanner.rs` refuses HLTV demos at the header:
//!
//! ```text
//!     match is_hltv_demo(path) {
//!         Ok(true) => return Err("Unsupported HLTV proxy demo format"),
//!         ...
//!     }
//! ```
//!
//! #247's first two questions are whether that guard still protects against
//! anything, and what would come out without it. Both are answerable offline,
//! against the real demo library, and that is what this does.
//!
//! It runs the scanner's own entry point first — so the guard's behaviour is
//! observed rather than described — and then runs the *same* analysis the
//! scanner would have run afterwards, reporting the streaks its per-player loop
//! would have iterated. Nothing here reimplements the scanner: the streak list
//! it walks is `analysis.state.players[..].kill_streaks`, read here directly.
//!
//!     cargo run --release -p native --example hltv_scan_probe -- <demo-or-dir>
//!
//! One line per demo, plus a summary. A demo that panics the parser takes the
//! process with it, which is itself the answer to "does it still break" — run
//! it per file if that matters.
