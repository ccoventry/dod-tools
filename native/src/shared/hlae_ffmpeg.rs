//! Whether HLAE can reach an FFmpeg, which is a different question from whether
//! *we* can.
//!
//! `mirv_movie_ffmpeg` makes HLAE spawn FFmpeg itself, and HLAE does not consult
//! the app's own resolution chain (User Override → Bundled → System Path). Per
//! `<HLAE>/ffmpeg/readme.advancedfx.txt` it looks in exactly two places:
//!
//!   - `<HLAE>/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe`, or
//!   - the path named by `[Ffmpeg] Path=` in `<HLAE>/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.ini`.
//!
//! With neither present the feature fails in the least helpful way available: a
//! capture that runs to completion and produces no video. So the state is worth
//! reporting before a batch, not after.
//!
//! **Linking writes a two-line ini rather than copying the binary.** A copy
//! duplicates ~100 MB and creates a second FFmpeg to keep in step with the one
//! Render Studio uses; they drift, and then the two halves of the pipeline
//! encode with different builds.
//!
//! **Somebody else's ini is never overwritten.** HLAE is shared with Source work
//! and other projects, so silently repointing it would break someone else's
//! workflow to fix ours. Where one exists and disagrees, that is reported and
//! left alone — the same discipline `patch::cfg_scan` applies to the game's own
//! `.cfg` files.
//!
//! What is protected is a *configuration*, not a filename. An ini with no
//! `Path=` in it — empty, or comments only — states nothing, holds no data to
//! lose, and is written over. Refusing there would strand someone behind a file
//! that does nothing, in a folder they usually cannot edit without
//! administrator rights.
//!
//! A file *this app* wrote is a different matter, and is rewritten on request.
//! Treating those as untouchable too would make the first link permanent: change
//! the app's FFmpeg afterwards and HLAE stays pointed at the old one, with no
//! way back through the UI and a folder that usually needs administrator rights
//! to edit by hand. See `docs/direct_to_video_capture.md`.
