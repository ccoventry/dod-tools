//! CLI utility to test decal hygiene in isolation: strips wall-decal messages
//! outside the given capture windows, injects ring-sweeping flush bursts ahead
//! of each window, and pins r_decals so the sweep is cheap. Writes a patched
//! demo for manual playback verification in HLAE before any of this gets wired
//! into the real capture batch pipeline.
