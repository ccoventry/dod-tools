//! One batch's worth of OBS driving.
//!
//! Owns the connection, turns console-log markers into `StartRecord` /
//! `StopRecord`, and folds each finished file into the take-folder layout the
//! rest of the pipeline already understands.
//!
//! **Why the output is moved rather than left where OBS put it.** Render
//! Studio's scanner, the shared `is_renderable_take` predicate, `take_key`
//! matching between the capture and render views, and the export-pool routing
//! all key off `<take_folder>/take0000/<stream>/`. Writing into that shape
//! means none of them need a second artefact layout taught to them — the same
//! trick `docs/direct_to_video_capture.md` used for `mirv_movie_ffmpeg`.
//!
//! The move is a rename, not a copy: `SetRecordDirectory` points OBS at the
//! destination folder *before* recording, so the file is already on the right
//! drive and only its name changes. That is also what preserves the per-block
//! export-pool routing across drives.
