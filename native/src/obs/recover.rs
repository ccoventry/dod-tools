//! Recovering an OBS recording that outlived the app.
//!
//! **Why this exists rather than a better cleanup path.** `CaptureCleanupGuard`
//! stops OBS on every exit path the process actually gets to run — a cancel, a
//! crashed game, a finished batch. It does not run on a panic: this workspace
//! builds release with `panic = "abort"` (`Cargo.toml`), so there is no
//! unwinding and no `Drop`. It also cannot run on a hard kill, an access
//! violation, a `tauri dev` restart, or a power cut.
//!
//! Those four are indistinguishable from the outside and no in-process
//! mechanism can cover them, because in all four the process is simply gone.
//! So the recovery is on the way back in rather than on the way out: ask OBS,
//! on start-up, whether it is still recording into a folder that could only be
//! ours.
//!
//! Without this, an orphaned recording runs until the disk fills. `preflight`
//! refuses to start a batch while OBS is already recording, so it surfaces
//! eventually — but "eventually" is the next time the user starts a batch, and
//! the disk does not wait.
