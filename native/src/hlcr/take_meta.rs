//! What a take was actually captured at, recorded beside it.
//!
//! Render Studio's FPS is a per-job setting the user picks (the VirtualDub-style
//! model), and nothing ever connected it to the FPS the take was recorded at.
//! `-framerate` before the BMP input tells FFmpeg how to interpret the
//! sequence's timing, so a value disagreeing with the capture produces a wrong
//! computed duration and `-shortest` trims the audio against it: a 120fps take
//! rendered at 300 comes out 2.5x too fast, silently, and the render reports
//! success. `docs/engineering_backlog.md` has the full diagnosis — it was found
//! by ear, from a render that "sounds like a helicopter".
//!
//! There was no source of truth to check the render setting against. This is it:
//! one small file per take, written into its block folder after the batch has
//! been verified, recording the `mirv_movie_fps` it was produced at.
//!
//! Per take, not per session, so it travels with the take. Two batches at
//! different rates already land in different session folders, so a session-level
//! file would be correct for that — but only until somebody moves a take, at
//! which point it would inherit whatever the folder it landed in says. That is
//! this exact bug reintroduced one level up.
//!
//! Deliberately **advisory**. Nothing here overrides the user's render setting —
//! a take folder can be moved, copied or hand-assembled, and a renderer that
//! silently substituted a number found in a neighbouring file would be a worse
//! surprise than the one it fixes. It exists so the disagreement can be *stated*.
