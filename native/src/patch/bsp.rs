//
// ── Why the decal flush reads maps at all ────────────────────────────────────
// Every source of flush positions the pipeline had before this one is drawn
// from player behaviour: harvested decals are where somebody shot, floor points
// are where somebody walked. That correlates with where the camera looked,
// which is exactly what the line-of-sight test rejects — so the demos that fail
// generate tens of thousands of candidates and keep none of them. The map's own
// geometry is the one surface source that owes nothing to what happened in the
// match. See `docs/decal_flush_bsp_surfaces.md`.
//
// It answers two questions, and only parses what they need. Lighting,
// clipnodes, marksurfaces and entities are skipped entirely.
//
//   1. WHERE ARE THE SURFACES — planes, vertices, edges, surfedges, faces,
//      texinfo, textures, models. Coordinates that owe nothing to the match.
//   2. WHAT CAN SEE WHAT — nodes, leaves, visibility. The flush's safety claim
//      is that its decals are never on screen, and a cone test with no notion
//      of walls is a poor way to establish that.
//
// ── Trusting these offsets ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The struct layouts below are the documented v30 format, not something
// verified against a file by hand. They are not taken on trust either:
// `nearest_face` exists so thousands of coordinates the engine provably
// accepted — every harvested decal in every demo — can be run against the
// parsed geometry. If a lump offset, an edge winding or a coordinate space is
// wrong, that check collapses rather than quietly producing plausible garbage.
