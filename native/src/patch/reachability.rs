//
// Same principle as `decal_strip::proven_world_coordinates` and
// `map_fetch`'s BSP-build validation: a position the engine sent a real
// player entity to is proof, not a guess, and beats any hand-built bounding
// box or convex hull of "the playable area." More demos of the same map only
// narrow the gaps -- different rounds and spawns cover different ground.
//
// This harvests *player* origins specifically (entity indices 1..=32, not
// decal impacts), because the question here is "could a player ever be near
// this entity", not "is this surface visible."
