// patch/decal_strip.rs
// Decal hygiene for capture demos: keeps walls clean at the start of every
// recorded clip without reloading the demo.
//
// ── Why r_decals alone cannot do this ────────────────────────────────────────
// GoldSrc stores decals in a fixed pool with a single rotating index:
//
//     limit = min(r_decals, MAX_RENDER_DECALS)
//     if (gDecalCount >= limit) gDecalCount = 0;
//     pdecal = &gDecalPool[gDecalCount++];
//     R_DecalUnlink(pdecal);          // the ONLY path that clears an old decal
//
// A decal is removed *only* when the ring index lands on its slot. The cvar
// never sweeps anything — it just bounds how far the index may travel before
// wrapping. Lowering r_decals mid-demo therefore strands every decal sitting in
// a slot >= the new limit: the index can no longer reach them, so they stay on
// the wall permanently while new decals churn through the small surviving
// window. (That asymmetry is exactly what you see in game when dropping
// r_decals from 5555 to 1.) The clean walls at demo load come from
// R_ClearDecals() on level load, not from the cvar.
//
// ── What this module does instead ────────────────────────────────────────────
// Two complementary passes over the demo's own byte stream:
//
//  1. STRIP — replace decal-creating messages outside the capture windows with
//     SvcNop, so the fast-forwarded stretches between clips contribute no
//     buildup at all. SvcNop is one byte on the wire and demo_writer recomputes
//     payload lengths, so no manual offset math is involved.
//
//  2. FLUSH BURST — pin r_decals to a modest ring size, then inject exactly
//     that many synthetic decals into the gap before each clip. That walks the
//     ring index a full revolution, unlinking every real decal still on a wall.
//     They are spread across many positions rather than stacked at one (see
//     `resolve_flush_positions` and MAX_OVERLAP_DECALS below — a stack stops
//     advancing the ring after the sixth), each ranked by how far it stays from
//     every in-clip camera, so they land where the capture never looks.
//
// Pinning the ring small is what makes the burst cheap: a sweep costs
// `ring_limit` injections regardless of how many decals are actually out there,
// so 256 keeps a full flush at ~2KB of injected messages instead of the ~36KB a
// 4096-slot ring would need.
