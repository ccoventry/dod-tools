# Raising GoldSrc's interpolation ceiling

How `dodtools_ex_interp_max` works, and why the engine's own 200 ms path does
not. Answers #271.

Offline analysis of the pre-Anniversary `hw.dll` (`pefile` + `capstone`),
checked by `goldsrc-hooks/tools/verify_ex_interp_offsets.py`.

## 1. `ex_interp` is engine-managed

A clamp at `hw+0x18ee0` runs every frame, forces `ex_interp` into a range, and
**writes the clamped result back through `Cvar_Set`** — printing `ex_interp
forced up to %i msec` or `forced down to %i msec`. Setting the cvar by hand and
expecting it to stay does not work, and that is the engine's behaviour rather
than anything DoD does.

```asm
hw+0x18ef3  mov edi, 0x32          ; floor, 50 ms
hw+0x18ef8  mov ebx, 0x64          ; ceiling, 100 ms
hw+0x18f5f  mov eax, [0x2d5df84]   ; a flag
hw+0x18f64  test eax, eax
hw+0x18f68  mov ebx, 0xc8          ; ceiling, 200 ms, when it is set
hw+0x18f82  fld  [1000.0]
hw+0x18f88  fdiv [cl_updaterate]   ; the real floor, at least 1
            ...clamp into [edi, ebx], print, Cvar_Set it back
```

A longer window means smoother entity motion between snapshots, which is where
most spectated-demo ugliness comes from. 100 ms is a *network* compromise; a
demo being rendered offline has no latency budget to protect.

## 2. The 200 ms path is dead

#271 asked what the flag at `0x2d5df84` is, and reasoned that if it means "we
are playing a demo" then demos already get 200 ms and the work is worth half.

They do not. Within `hw.dll` the flag has exactly **four** write sites — found
by searching every x86 addressing form for a write to an absolute address, not
just the obvious `mov dword [x], imm32`:

| site | what | value |
|---|---|---|
| `hw+0x1087a` | `mov [flag], ebx` | in the demo reader, `ebx` zeroed |
| `hw+0x10a58` | `mov dword [flag], 0` | in the demo reader |
| `hw+0x18537` | `mov [flag], ebx` | in a block zeroing a dozen fields |
| `hw+0x1d791` | `mov dword [flag], 1` | **unreachable** |

The only site that writes 1 has:

- no direct call to it,
- no near jump to it,
- **no absolute reference anywhere in the image**, so no jump table and no
  function pointer,
- and the five bytes before it are `jmp hw+0x2a960`, an unconditional branch,
  so nothing falls through.

So the engine never takes its own 200 ms branch. The ceiling is a hard 100, and
raising it is the only way up — which makes #271 worth what it looked like
rather than half.

`verify_ex_interp_offsets.py` reproduces every one of those checks rather than
restating them.

## 3. The flag is not the lever

Setting it would be one dword and looks tempting. It is **read from 25 sites**,
including inside `CL_ParseServerMessage`, the `svc_*` handlers and
`CL_CheckCRCs`. Flipping a feature switch the retail build never sets, to find
out what else it turns on, is not a thing to do inside someone's capture run.

Rewriting the immediate is the narrow change: it affects the clamp and nothing
else, and it reverts by writing 100 back.

---

## 4. What still bounds it

`cl_updaterate` sets the floor as `1000 / cl_updaterate`, a few instructions
below the ceiling. A demo recorded at a low update rate cannot be interpolated
below what it captured, so raising the ceiling does **not** make a 20-tick
recording smooth. What it does is stop the engine shortening a window that was
already long enough.

Say so when reporting it, or the first response will be "it does nothing".

---

## 5. Engine-wide, deliberately

The `hw.dll` survey's standing preference is to do a thing in `client.dll`
where an equivalent exists, because an engine change affects the menu and every
mod. There is no client-side equivalent — the clamp is the engine's — and this
install exists only to render demos.

Movies install only, as everything injected is. The stock Half-Life install is
VAC-secured and nothing goes near it.

---

## 6. The setting

```
dodtools_ex_interp_max 250     raise the clamp's ceiling to 250 ms
dodtools_ex_interp_max 100     put the engine's own ceiling back
```

A cvar rather than a command, because it holds a value, and it defaults to 100
— the engine's own ceiling — so registering it changes nothing until asked.
`commands::poll` applies it every frame, which is what makes a change take
effect without a restart.

Refused: anything at or below the engine's 50 ms floor (the clamp would pin
`ex_interp` to a single value and say so once per frame), and anything above
1000 ms, which stops being smoothing and starts being a rewrite of when things
happened.

The module refuses to overwrite a ceiling that is neither the engine's 100 nor
a value it would have written itself, so a second patcher is reported rather
than clobbered.
