# Demo-derived stats for KTP League — where this stands

**Start here if you're picking this up cold.** This is a separate work stream from the
Capture/Render Studio track in `active_sprint_state.md` / `engineering_backlog.md` — it
lives entirely on `dev`/`main` (commits `a86973a`, `8e6c3a5`, `c3b9c88`, `669d9f9`, all
merged, both branches identical as of 2026-08-22 — hashes corrected 2026-08-24, the
originally-recorded ones were unreachable from either branch, likely due to a history
rewrite), not on the capture/render feature
branches. If you're resuming work on capture/render quick-wins, this doc doesn't affect
you; if you're resuming the stats/league work, start here instead of re-deriving context.

## What this is

A friend runs the server/stats infrastructure for the KTP DoD 1.3 league (ktpleague.gg,
HLStatsX + custom AMXX plugins) and needs to backfill match stats for seasons 1–9, where
demos are the only surviving record. The question: how much of an HLStatsX-style
scoreboard can be reconstructed from `.dem` files alone, using `dod-tools`.

**The deliverable is a private Claude Artifact, not a file in this repo:**
`https://claude.ai/code/artifact/0481832b-dc0a-4726-baf3-e8be34fc55f5`

That artifact ("What the demo knows") is the actual spec — column-by-column coverage,
wire-format reference for every relevant DoD 1.3 user message, nine aggregation rules
with pseudocode, a `dod-tools` readiness assessment, and a HLStatsX join strategy. It is
the thing to read and update, not this file. This file just anchors it in the repo so a
fresh session (or a different AI) knows the artifact exists and what's true about the
codebase as of the last time it was checked against reality.

There's also a stale standalone copy at `C:\Users\chris\Downloads\ktp-demo-stats-spec.html`
(944 KB, fonts inlined) — it predates the fixes below and should not be treated as current.

## Headline findings (verified across 624 real demos)

- **9 of 13 HLStatsX scoreboard columns are demo-derivable**: player identity, kills,
  deaths, K/D, teamkills, suicides, objective points, flag-capture credits, flag-capture
  breaks. **4 are not, ever**: assists, damage, headshots, headshot%. GoldSrc/DoD 1.3
  never sends per-hit data to spectators — `DeathMsg` was exactly 3 bytes (killer,
  victim, weapon) in all 211,335 instances across the corpus. No hit group exists.
- HLTV demos are strictly better than POV for scoreboard purposes — everything broadcasts
  to all clients either way, but HLTV has cleaner rosters and reconciles better (76.9% vs
  74.6% exact agreement with the server's own frag counter).
- Two real bugs were found and fixed while validating this (see below): a live
  localization bug affecting 1,190 tokens, and a demo-type misclassification
  (`SvcDirector` appears in POV demos too, whenever an HLTV caster spectates — already
  documented in `bugs.md` from the capture/render side, root cause is the same message).
- `CapMsg` only ever names one flag-capper; ~20% of captures are multi-capper and the rest
  are recovered from same-frame `ObjScore` increments. This is scoped to the 126-demo LAN
  HLTV subset specifically, not the full corpus — flagged as a correction after an earlier
  draft mismeasured it with too wide a correlation window (27.4% → correct 19.8%).

## What's blocking dod-tools from actually producing these stats

The `analysis` crate's message filter (`is_relevant_message` in `analysis/src/lib.rs`,
~21-name allowlist) silently drops `CapMsg`, `InitObj`, `SetObj`, `StartProg`,
`CancelProg` before any parsing logic ever sees them. That single list is blocking 3 of
the 9 aggregation rules in the artifact (flag captures, flag ownership, cap blocks).
**Adding those 5 names is the single highest-leverage change** — it's a one-line diff
that unlocks two whole scoreboard columns. Full six-item punch list (this one plus half
modelling, per-player teamkill/suicide fields, the demo-type-check fix, a read-only stats
CLI entry point) is in the artifact's "What would make it usable for the league" section
— not reproduced here since the artifact is the source of truth and this list will drift.

## Repo changes already made in service of this (on dev/main)

- **Fixed a real localization bug** (`analysis/src/localization.rs`): `translate_key`
  prepended a `#` sigil on every lookup but never stripped one on insert, so any key
  stored bare (which is all 1,190 of them — `dod_english.txt`, `valve_english.txt`,
  `gameui_english.txt`, and now `dod_tools_english.txt` after this fix) silently failed
  to resolve. Fixed by normalizing (`trim_start_matches('#').to_lowercase()`) on both
  insert and lookup. `localizations/dod_tools_english.txt` had its 327 keys stripped of
  their `#` prefix to match the convention every other file already used. See
  `docs/staging_lessons.md`'s "Localization Key Canonicalization" entry.
- **Brought `main` current** — it was ~300 commits behind `dev` and still advertised a
  removed `egui` GUI. Fast-forwarded; `main`/`dev` are now identical.
- **Test suite is green**: 21 passed, 0 failed (was 4 failing before the localization fix
  and one stale fixture-dependent test — `test_inspect_lenn_demo` — was changed to skip
  rather than panic when its uncommitted fixture demo is absent).
- **Seven measurement probes committed** under `analysis/examples/` (with a README) —
  `msg_probe`, `scoreboard_probe`, `batch_probe`, `hltv_probe`, `reconcile_probe`,
  `reconnect_probe`, `capwindow_probe`. These produced every corpus-wide figure in the
  artifact; re-run them against your own demo folder to reproduce or extend the findings.
  **Note:** as of 2026-08-22 these exist on `dev`/`main` only — they are not present on
  `feature/capture-render-quick-wins` or other capture/render branches cut before the
  merge. If you're on one of those branches and want the probes, `git show
  dev:analysis/examples/<file>` rather than assuming they're in your working tree.
- **README rewritten** with a component-maturity table (stable: `dod/`, `analysis/`,
  `dem-patch/`, `hl-demo-auditor/`; active development: `native/`, `desktop-studio/`), the
  `dem`-fork rationale, and the localization key convention.

## One thing worth knowing if you're evaluating the `dem` crate independently

This project vendors a patched fork (`dem-patch/`) of the public `dem` crate
(crates.io, v0.2.3, github.com/khanghugo/dem) because the published crate `.unwrap()`s
delta-decoder table lookups at 29 call sites across 7 files — a malformed or unexpected
demo panics the whole process instead of returning a parse error. Confirmed still present
in v0.3.0. Full detail and the fix rationale is in the artifact's prior-art section, not
duplicated here.

## Next step, if resumed

Nothing is currently in progress. The artifact was last updated 2026-08-22 (consistency
pass + section reorder + provenance-in-masthead). The natural next piece of actual code
work — not yet started — is admitting the five objective messages into
`is_relevant_message`, since it's small and unlocks the most value. Confirm with the user
before starting feature work; this doc and the artifact are both descriptive, not a
commitment to build anything yet.
