//! `dodtools_hide_hand_signals`: stop players miming their voice commands.
//!
//! ## Why the voice mute does not cover this
//!
//! `dodtools_mute_voice_commands` NOPs a client-side `EV_PlaySound` call, which
//! is where the *sound* comes from. The gesture is a different mechanism
//! entirely: `client.dll` contains **no `hs_` string at all**, because the
//! client never picks these animations by name. The server picks a sequence
//! index, and it arrives as replicated entity state -- `curstate.sequence` --
//! which is also why it survives into an HLTV demo.
//!
//! So there is no call to remove. What there is, every frame, is a number in a
//! structure this DLL can already read.
//!
//! ## Detection is by label, not by index
//!
//! #283 measured the sequence indices: 54 `hs_*` sequences per player model,
//! in two contiguous runs at 212-238 and 287-313, identical across all five
//! stock models. It also flagged the risk in using them -- 17 of the user's 41
//! viewmodels are custom, and a custom *player* model could reorder its
//! sequence list.
//!
//! So this does not use the indices. It reads the model's own sequence labels
//! -- the same `mstudioseqdesc_t` walk `anim_fix` already does and caches -- and
//! asks whether the label starts with `hs_`. That is exact for any model,
//! custom or stock, and a model that reorders its sequences is handled rather
//! than mis-suppressed.
//!
//! ## What is substituted
//!
//! A sequence index has to be *something*, so blanking is not an option. Each
//! player's last non-`hs_` sequence is remembered and put back for the duration
//! of the signal, which is their stance/weapon idle or aim in every case that
//! matters. A player first seen mid-signal has no remembered sequence, so they
//! are left alone rather than given a guess -- counted, and reported by
//! `dodtools_status`.
//!
//! `gaitsequence` is deliberately untouched. It drives the legs independently,
//! and the standing/prone split in the `hs_` names says the signal is an
//! upper-body sequence, so substituting `sequence` alone should be the whole
//! job. If a signal ever turns out to move the legs too, that is where to look.
//!
//! ## Where the write happens, and why it should be early enough
//!
//! #283's remaining open question was whether a write lands before the renderer
//! reads it. This runs from `commands::poll`, which the crate drives from the
//! `HUD_Frame` trampoline -- and `HUD_Frame` is called once per frame *before*
//! the engine renders the view, not from `HUD_Redraw`, which paints the HUD
//! after it. So the write is in place for the same frame's `StudioDrawPlayer`.
//!
//! That is an argument from call order, not a measurement. If a live test shows
//! the gesture surviving, the fallback the issue names is right: the studio
//! renderer's `StudioDrawPlayer`, reachable through the interface already
//! captured in slot 39.
//!
//! ## It applies to every player in view
//!
//! Not only the spectated one, which is what clean footage wants and is a
//! behavioural choice rather than an obvious default -- #283 said so and the
//! status line repeats it.
