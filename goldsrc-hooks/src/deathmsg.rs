//! `dodstudio_deathmsg` — control over DoD 1.3's death notices (the kill feed).
//!
//! HLAE ships `mirv_deathmsg` with the same four subcommands, but only for
//! `cstrike` and `tfc`: its pattern database names them explicitly
//! (`cstrike_CHudDeathNotice_Draw`, `tfc_rgDeathNoticeList`, …) and there is no
//! `dod_` entry. So none of it works for Day of Defeat, and no amount of
//! configuration makes it. This is the DoD implementation.
//!
//! ## What the game does
//!
//! DoD's `client.dll` uses the stock Half-Life SDK death-notice code unchanged:
//!
//! ```c
//! #define MAX_DEATHNOTICES 4
//! struct DeathNoticeItem {          // 156 bytes, confirmed field-by-field
//!     char  szKiller[64];           // +0x00
//!     char  szVictim[64];           // +0x40
//!     int   iId;                    // +0x80   sprite index; 0 == empty slot
//!     int   iSuicide;               // +0x84
//!     int   iTeamKill;              // +0x88
//!     int   iNonPlayerKill;         // +0x8c
//!     float flDisplayTime;          // +0x90
//!     float *KillerColor;           // +0x94
//!     float *VictimColor;           // +0x98
//! };
//! static DeathNoticeItem rgDeathNoticeList[MAX_DEATHNOTICES + 1];
//! ```
//!
//! `InitHUDData` gives the array away as a `rep stosd` of 0xc3 dwords — 780
//! bytes, exactly five 156-byte slots.
//!
//! ## Two mechanisms, not one
//!
//! `block` and `fake` need no code patching at all, because of how the engine
//! installs user-message handlers. `pfnHookUserMsg` does **not** overwrite an
//! existing entry: it allocates a fresh record, copies the matching one over it
//! (carrying the message number and size across), sets the new handler, and
//! *prepends* it to `gClientUserMsgs`. The by-number dispatcher walks from the
//! head and stops at the first match. So the most recent hook wins, and
//! `client.dll`'s own handler stays reachable by calling it directly. See
//! [`crate::engine::HookUserMsgFn`].
//!
//! `max` and `offset` do need patching, and `max` needs the array **moved**:
//! it is five slots and there is no slack after it — live data is referenced at
//! array-end + 0. Every one of the 34 absolute references to it lives in
//! `.text`, inside four functions, and nothing in `.data` or any vtable points
//! at it, so relocating it is a closed problem. All 34 carry base relocations,
//! which is why every address here is an RVA rebased through
//! [`crate::engine::client_module_base`] rather than a literal.
//!
//! ## DoD's DeathMsg payload differs from CS's
//!
//! Three bytes: killer index, victim index, and a **weapon index** 1..=43 into
//! a table of `d_*` sprite names ([`WEAPON_SPRITES`]) — not a weapon string.
//! Out-of-range falls back to `d_world`. There is no headshot flag, so HLAE's
//! `<0|1>` argument has no DoD equivalent and `fake` takes a weapon instead.
//!
//! Analysis subject: `dod/cl_dlls/client.dll`, 977,816 bytes, byte-identical
//! across the stock, pre-Anniversary and post-Anniversary installs.
