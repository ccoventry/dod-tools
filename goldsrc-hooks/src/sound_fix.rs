//! Makes DoD 1.3 weapon-fire sounds carry further while spectating (HLTV or a
//! regular demo's in-eye/free camera), **without** flattening them into
//! ambience.
//!
//! ## What the problem actually is
//!
//! Not missing sounds. Comparing an HLTV demo against a POV demo of the same
//! match half (`analysis/examples/hltv_sound_probe.rs`) shows the HLTV demo
//! carrying *more* weapon-fire events than the POV one -- 1391 vs 1248, with
//! every weapon represented. Every shot is already being requested, so there
//! is nothing to synthesise and no event to re-fire.
//!
//! What actually happens is ordinary GoldSrc distance falloff. Shots arrive at
//! `ATTN_NORM` (0.8), which goes inaudible at roughly 1250 units, and DoD's
//! maps are far larger than that -- so gunfire across the map is requested,
//! spatialised, and then attenuated to silence.
//!
//! ## What this does
//!
//! Lowers the attenuation of weapon-fire samples so they carry further, and
//! *only* lowers it -- a sample that already carries further than the
//! configured value is left alone. Volume is not touched at all, so the
//! engine's own distance calculation still sets the final level and relative
//! dynamics between near and far shots survive.
//!
//! Crucially it does not use `ATTN_NONE` (0.0). In GoldSrc that doesn't mean
//! "no falloff" so much as "not a positional sound at all" -- every shot plays
//! at full level with no direction, which sounds like the whole match is
//! happening at the camera. That was this module's first implementation and it
//! was wrong; see `CARRY_ATTENUATION` for the tunable that replaced it.
//!
//! Every DoD 1.3 weapon's firing sample is named `<weapon>_shoot.wav`
//! (confirmed against the game's own installed sound files -- garand_shoot,
//! kar_shoot, bar_shoot, mp44_shoot, luger_shoot, mg42_shoot, ... every one
//! of them, no exceptions found), which is enough on its own to distinguish
//! a gunshot from reloads, footsteps, voice lines, etc. -- no need to also
//! track weapon-fire *events* the way the animation fix does.
