//! `dodtools_clear_decals`: empty the engine's decal pool at runtime.
//!
//! ## What this replaces
//!
//! `r_decals` bounds a rotating index and **evicts nothing**, so lowering it
//! strands every decal sitting above the new limit rather than removing it.
//! That is why the pipeline's decal hygiene has to be baked into the demo: pin
//! the ring small at load time, then inject a full revolution's worth of
//! synthetic decals into the gap before each clip so the index walks past every
//! real one (`native/src/patch/decal_strip.rs`). It works, and it costs a
//! demo rewrite, a load-time-only constraint on `r_decals`, and a standing rule
//! that the cvar must never be injected mid-demo because an extra
//! `ConsoleCommand` frame shifts every later frame ordinal by +1.
//!
//! None of that is needed if the walls can simply be wiped on command.
//!
//! ## The engine already has every piece
//!
//! #290 named the safe route first -- "find what the engine does on level load
//! and reuse it" -- and it is there:
//!
//! ```text
//!   hw+0x49e80  R_DecalUnlink(decal_t *)   detaches one decal from its
//!                                          surface's list; a NULL psurface
//!                                          returns early, so a free slot is
//!                                          safe to pass
//!   hw+0x49da0  R_DecalInit()              memset the whole pool, gDecalCount
//!                                          = 0, and reset the 256-entry decal
//!                                          texture table
//!   hw+0x4a000  R_DecalRemoveAll<by flag>  the pattern this copies: for each
//!                                          slot, unlink then zero 28 bytes
//! ```
//!
//! **`R_DecalInit` alone would be a crash.** It wipes the pool without
//! unlinking, so every `msurface_t::pdecals` left pointing into it becomes a
//! chain of zeroed structures the renderer will still walk. It is only safe on
//! level load because the surfaces are being rebuilt anyway. What makes the
//! engine's own *remove* functions safe is that they unlink first, and that is
//! what is reproduced here -- over every slot rather than over the ones
//! matching a texture or a flag.
//!
//! Nothing is invented: the loop below is byte-for-byte what `hw+0x4a000`
//! does, with its `if (flags & mask)` dropped.
//!
//! ## Pre-Anniversary only, and loudly so
//!
//! The two signatures match the pre-Anniversary `hw.dll` exactly once each.
//! `R_DecalInit`'s also matches the 25th-Anniversary engine (at a different
//! address), but the remove-by-flag loop does **not** -- that build compiled it
//! differently, so `R_DecalUnlink` cannot be recovered from it this way. Since
//! dod-tools only ever launches the pre-Anniversary movies install
//! (`docs/` and the two-installs rule), this refuses rather than guesses.
//!
//! ## Everything is read out of the instruction stream
//!
//! No address here is written down. The pool's base and end, the decal size,
//! `gDecalCount` and `R_DecalUnlink` are all immediates or relative calls
//! inside the two matched functions, and they cross-check each other: both
//! signatures must agree on the pool base, and the span between base and end
//! must equal the `memset` length `R_DecalInit` passes.
