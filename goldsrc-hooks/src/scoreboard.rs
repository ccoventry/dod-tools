//! `dodtools_scoreboard`: stop a POV demo's recorded TAB presses from putting
//! the scoreboard on screen.
//!
//! ## The problem this exists for
//!
//! A POV demo replays whatever the recording player typed, and a key bound to
//! `+showscores` is no exception: pressing TAB during a match writes a Type-3
//! `ConsoleCommand` frame into the demo, and playback executes it. So every
//! time the player checked the score, the scoreboard covers the shot. HLTV
//! demos do not have this problem -- nobody was pressing anything -- which is
//! why it looks like a POV-only quirk.
//!
//! The workaround before this was to edit `dod/resource/ui/ScoreBoard.res` and
//! move the dialog off-screen. That works, but it is a persistent edit to a
//! game file for a per-take decision, and it has to be undone to read a score
//! again.
//!
//! ## Why there is no cvar for it already
//!
//! There isn't one, and the reason is structural. DoD's scoreboard is **not a
//! HUD element** -- it is VGUI2, `CDoDClientScoreBoardDialog` :
//! `CClientScoreBoardDialog` : `IScoreBoardInterface`, laid out from
//! `Resource/UI/ScoreBoard.res`. It appears nowhere in the HUD element
//! inventory (`docs/goldsrc_client_dll_survey.md` section 1), so `hud_draw 0`
//! walks straight past it. The only score-related cvar DoD's client registers
//! at all is `spec_scoreboard`, which is spectator-mode-only and toggles on
//! change rather than gating anything.
//!
//! ## What this patches, and why it is one byte
//!
//! `+showscores` is registered to a function whose entire body is eight
//! instructions:
//!
//! ```text
//!     push 0x1a8aa24        ; the in_score kbutton
//!     call client+0x3bae0   ; KeyDown bookkeeping
//!     mov  ecx, [gViewPort]
//!     add  esp, 4
//!     test ecx, ecx
//!     je   .done            ; <- 74 05
//!     mov  eax, [ecx]
//!     jmp  [eax+0x18]       ; ShowScoreBoard
//! .done:
//!     ret
//! ```
//!
//! Turning that `je` (`74`) into a `jmp` (`EB`) makes the branch
//! unconditional, so the function always falls through to its own `ret`. One
//! byte, and the displacement is already correct because the landing site does
//! not move.
//!
//! Patching the `je` rather than writing `C3` over the entry point is
//! deliberate: the `call` above it is the engine's `+`/`-` key bookkeeping for
//! the `in_score` kbutton, and skipping it would leave that state claiming the
//! key is up while it is held. Only the virtual call is removed.
//!
//! `-showscores` is left alone. Hiding an already-hidden dialog is a no-op, and
//! leaving it working is what makes the suppression self-correcting: a
//! scoreboard already on screen when this is switched on disappears at the
//! player's next key release rather than sticking.
//!
//! ## Scope, stated plainly
//!
//! This suppresses the **command**. DoD also shows the scoreboard at round end
//! and through `spec_scoreboard`, and those reach the dialog by other call
//! sites that have not been traced. If a take needs "no scoreboard under any
//! circumstances", this is not yet that.
