//! Drives the first-person viewmodel's animations while spectating a player
//! in-eye, which the engine otherwise leaves largely static.
//!
//! ## Why the animations are missing
//!
//! Structural, not a bug. GoldSrc's weapon event scripts animate the viewmodel
//! only for the **local** player -- the `EV_IsLocal` check in every
//! `events/weapons/*.sc`. Every other player gets the sound and the muzzle
//! flash but no first-person animation, because normally nobody is looking
//! down their sights. Spectating in-eye, and HLTV playback in particular, is
//! exactly the case that assumption does not hold for: the viewmodel on screen
//! belongs to someone who is not the local player, so firing, reloading and
//! drawing never reach it.
//!
//! ## What this drives, and from where
//!
//! - **shoot** -- from the spectated player's own body animation. DoD's player
//!   models name every sequence `<stance>_<weapon>_<action>`, so
//!   `stand_bolt_shoot` or `bipod_mg_shoot` says outright that they are firing,
//!   and that is replicated entity state present in an HLTV demo. The
//!   weapon-fire *sound* is kept as a second trigger (`on_weapon_fired`), which
//!   matters only for automatic fire: a held trigger leaves the body sequence
//!   sitting on the same `_shoot` label, so the individual rounds after the
//!   first have no sequence change to key off.
//! - **reload** -- from the spectated player's body animation as well
//!   (`crouch_bar_reload`, `prone_webley_reload`, ...).
//! - **draw** -- when the viewmodel *settles* on a different weapon. Not
//!   simply when it changes: the viewmodel rotates through several of a
//!   player's weapons many times a second, so a bare change test starts a draw
//!   ten times a second and none of them survive long enough to be seen.
//! - **idle** -- on switching to a different spectated player, so the new
//!   viewmodel does not inherit whatever sequence the last one was left on.
//!
//! ## Bipod weapons, additionally
//!
//! MG42, MG34, BAR and Bren keep two parallel sequence families in one model
//! -- "up" (hip-fire) and "down" (deployed), e.g. `upidle`/`downidle` -- and
//! nothing tells a puppeted in-eye viewmodel which to use. Unlike Counter-
//! Strike's silenced/unsilenced M4A1 fix this was modeled on, DoD's deploy
//! state is not hidden in a fire-event side channel: it drives a real,
//! always-replicated `entity_state_t::weaponmodel` swap between two
//! third-person models (`p_mg42bu.mdl` <-> `p_mg42bd.mdl`), so it can be read
//! directly each frame. Every animation above is then looked up within
//! whichever family is current. Confirmed against the `.mdl` files shipped
//! with DoD 1.3.
//!
//! This part matters far less in practice than the plain animations: league
//! configs generally limit the MGs to zero, and deploying the BAR's bipod is
//! rare. It is a refinement on top, not the point.
//!
//! Originally ported from a prototype written against HLAE's own source
//! (`AfxHookGoldSrc/hooks/client/dod/ViewmodelAnimationFix.cpp`), adapted to
//! the engine interfaces this crate captures itself.
