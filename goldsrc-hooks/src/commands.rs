//! The `dodstudio_*` console surface: four cvars and one command.
//!
//! ## Why cvars rather than commands
//!
//! These were four `pfnAddCommand` commands, and the difference is not
//! cosmetic. A command is a function the engine calls and forgets; the state
//! lives in this DLL's own atomics, where the console cannot see it. So
//! `dodstudio_hltv_animation_fix` printed nothing in the type-ahead, could not
//! be queried with a bare name the way `sensitivity` can, and — the part that
//! actually mattered — could not be set from a config file or the launch line.
//! That last gap is the entire reason `GOLDSRC_HOOKS_ANIM_FIX` and
//! `ANIM_FIX_DEFAULT` existed.
//!
//! A cvar is a named box the *engine* owns. It shows up in the type-ahead with
//! its value, answers `dodstudio_hltv_animation_fix` on its own, takes
//! `+dodstudio_hltv_animation_fix 1` on the launch line, and can be set from any
//! `.cfg` the user execs. `poll()` copies the values into the same atomics the
//! rest of the crate already reads, once per frame, so nothing downstream
//! changed.
//!
//! ## Not archived, deliberately
//!
//! `FCVAR_ARCHIVE` would make the engine write these into the user's
//! `config.cfg` when it quits. It is not set. The pipeline's standing rule is
//! that the game's own `.cfg` files belong to the user and are detected and
//! warned about, never written (`native/src/patch/cfg_scan.rs`, and the rule in
//! `CLAUDE.md`), and a capture-time DLL quietly adding lines to `config.cfg`
//! is exactly that. Setting from a `.cfg` or the launch line still works
//! without archiving, which is the part that retires the environment
//! variables. Flip `CVAR_FLAGS` to `FCVAR_ARCHIVE` if that trade is ever
//! wanted the other way round.
//!
//! ## The fallback
//!
//! If `pfnRegisterVariable` does not hand back a cvar whose own `name` matches
//! what was asked for, the layout assumption is wrong and every subsequent read
//! would be garbage. That case registers the old commands instead and says so
//! loudly, so a bad assumption costs the type-ahead rather than the session.
//!
//! Registration must happen after `engine::engfuncs()` is captured (i.e. after
//! `client.dll`'s real `Initialize` has run), since both `pfnRegisterVariable`
//! and `pfnAddCommand` live on that same table.
