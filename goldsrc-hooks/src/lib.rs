//! Standalone companion DLL for DoD 1.3 GoldSrc capture sessions, injected
//! into `hl.exe` alongside (not instead of) HLAE's own `AfxHookGoldSrc.dll`.
//!
//! Unlike patching HLAE's own source, this doesn't need HLAE's build
//! toolchain, and doesn't touch any function HLAE itself already hooks (see
//! `engine.rs` for exactly which functions this DLL depends on). It's built
//! as a separate workspace crate specifically so it doesn't have to live
//! inside a forked copy of HLAE's own repository. How it gets a foothold in
//! `client.dll` is genuinely non-obvious -- patching that DLL's export table
//! does nothing on a "secured" build, because the engine resolves the whole
//! client interface through a single `F` export instead. See `engine.rs`'s
//! module docs and `docs/goldsrc_client_dll_internals.md`.
//!
//! Implements two fixes, each independently toggled and each safe to inject
//! without the other:
//! - `sound_fix`: force full-volume weapon-fire audio while spectating.
//! - `anim_fix`: correct MG42/MG34/BAR/Bren viewmodel deploy animations
//!   while spectating in-eye.
//!
//! See each module's docs for the full R&D reasoning.
//!
//! Each fix has a default set via an environment variable on the `hl.exe`
//! process before launch (`GOLDSRC_HOOKS_FORCE_WEAPON_VOLUME=1`,
//! `GOLDSRC_HOOKS_ANIM_FIX=1`), and can also be toggled live from the game
//! console via `dodtools_hltv_gunshots_fix <0|1>` / `dodtools_hltv_animation_fix
//! <0|1>` (see `commands.rs`) -- either mechanism flips the same runtime
//! flag, so whichever is more convenient for a given session works.
