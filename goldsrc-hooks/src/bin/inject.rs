//! Minimal manual DLL injector for testing goldsrc-hooks against a running
//! hl.exe, independent of any future dod-tools capture-pipeline wiring.
//!
//! Usage: inject <pid> <path-to-dll>
//!
//! Standard technique: allocate a small buffer in the target process for the
//! DLL path, write the path into it, then start a remote thread whose entry
//! point is kernel32!LoadLibraryA with that buffer as its argument -- the
//! same effect as the target process calling LoadLibraryA itself.
