//! `dodtools_hide_sprite` — suppress specific map-placed `env_sprite`
//! entities by their model path (e.g. `sprites/mapsprites/caparea.spr`).
//!
//! ## Why `dodtools_hide_hudelement` can't reach this
//!
//! That module (issue #265) patches the classic 2D HUD element list —
//! `CHud::Redraw` walking `CHudBase`-derived elements' vftable slot 3. An
//! `env_sprite` is a completely different code path: server-replicated
//! entity data the map's own BSP entity lump points at, rendered through the
//! engine's normal entity renderer. There is no HUD element vftable to swap.
//! `client.dll` has **zero** references to the string `"caparea"` anywhere in
//! the binary (confirmed by a full binary string search) — it doesn't load
//! or draw this sprite by name at all, unlike `mapsprites/speakerIcon.spr`/
//! `voiceIcon.spr`, which are hardcoded HUD elements and already reachable
//! through `voice.rs`.
//!
//! ## The mechanism: `HUD_AddEntity`
//!
//! Slot 20 of the `cldll_func_t` table `engine.rs` already partially owns
//! (three of its 43 slots were already swapped for `Initialize`, `HUD_Frame`
//! and `HUD_GetStudioModelInterface` — see `docs/goldsrc_client_dll_internals.md`
//! §2). The slot index itself is checked the same rigorous way as the other
//! three, independently of the constant in `engine.rs`: disassemble `F`
//! directly and resolve what it actually writes into slot 20 back to its own
//! export name (`tools/verify_hide_sprite_slot.py`). The engine calls
//! `HUD_AddEntity(int type, cl_entity_t *ent, const
//! char *modelname)` once per entity it is about to add to the render list;
//! the client returns 0 to suppress that one entity, or nonzero to let it
//! through. This is the standard Half-Life SDK contract for that slot, and
//! is not established here by disassembling `hw.dll`'s own caller (a closed,
//! heavily obfuscated binary — see `docs/goldsrc_hw_dll_survey.md`) — it is
//! cross-checked the same way `engine.rs`'s own slot table is, against
//! Xash3D's open-source engine, whose `CL_AddVisibleEntity`-equivalent path
//! explicitly treats a zero return from this slot as "don't add". That is a
//! different, weaker standard of evidence than the byte-level verification
//! this crate holds a *patch* to (nothing here is patched), and is stated as
//! such rather than presented as disassembly-confirmed.
//!
//! ## Design: an allow-list, not a blanket toggle
//!
//! Deliberately not a `dodtools_hide_map_sprites 1` switch. Most of
//! `sprites/mapsprites/`'s neighbours are decorative and meaningful —
//! smoke, fire, tracers — and indiscriminately suppressing every map-placed
//! sprite would remove things nobody asked to have removed. This command
//! only ever hides model paths named explicitly, the same shape
//! `dodtools_deathmsg block <id>...` already uses for players.
//!
//! Analysis subject: `dod/cl_dlls/client.dll`, 977,816 bytes, byte-identical
//! across the stock, pre-Anniversary and post-Anniversary installs.
