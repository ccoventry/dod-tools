//! `dodtools_mute_voice_commands`: silence DoD's spoken voice commands without
//! overwriting the game's own `.wav` files.
//!
//! ## The problem this exists for
//!
//! "Fire in the hole!", "Move up!", "Yes sir!" -- the radio/voice commands
//! players bind to keys. In a demo they replay exactly as they were pressed,
//! and they land on top of whatever the clip is actually about.
//!
//! The workaround before this was to overwrite every `player/us*.wav`,
//! `player/brit*.wav` and `player/ger*.wav` in the game folder with a blank
//! sound. That works, but it is destroying shipped game content to make a
//! per-take decision -- and it is the sort of change this pipeline otherwise
//! refuses to make on a user's install (`CLAUDE.md`'s rule about the game's own
//! files).
//!
//! ## Where the sound comes from
//!
//! DoD plays voice commands through exactly two client event callbacks,
//! registered in `HUD_Init`:
//!
//! ```text
//!     pfnHookEvent("events/misc/usvoice.sc",  client+0xb3f0)   ; US *and* British
//!     pfnHookEvent("events/misc/gervoice.sc", client+0xb5d0)   ; German
//! ```
//!
//! Behind them sit three contiguous 28-entry `const char*` tables -- exactly
//! the files the blank-`.wav` trick overwrites:
//!
//! ```text
//!     +0x1c55c8   player/usattack.wav,   player/ushold.wav,   ...
//!     +0x1c5638   player/britattack.wav, player/brithold.wav, ...
//!     +0x1c56a8   player/gerattack.wav,  player/gerhold.wav,  ...
//! ```
//!
//! Each callback ends up at `pEventAPI->EV_PlaySound`, reached by
//! `call dword ptr [ebx]` -- `FF 13`.
//!
//! ## What this patches
//!
//! Those two `call`s become `90 90`. Two bytes each.
//!
//! The stack stays balanced without any other change, because the argument
//! cleanup is caller-side and separate (`add esp, 0x20` in the US/British
//! callback, `add esp, 0x24` in the German one) -- removing the call does not
//! move it.
//!
//! **This is the reason to patch the call rather than stub the callback.**
//! Everything after the call still runs, and what it does is print the chat
//! line. So this behaves exactly like the blank-`.wav` approach -- audio gone,
//! everything else untouched -- where a `ret` at the top of the callback would
//! have silently taken the chat line with it.
//!
//! The tail, read rather than assumed: it gets the speaker and the local
//! player, **returns if they are not on the same team**, **returns if the
//! observer-mode global is non-zero -- i.e. whenever you are spectating**,
//! returns if the speaker is too far away, and only then formats
//! `(PlayerName): <text>` from the `#Voice_subtitle_*` table and prints it
//! behind the `#VOICE` prefix.
//!
//! The practical consequence: in an HLTV demo the chat line never appears in
//! the first place, so this setting only ever removes the sound. In a POV demo
//! the chat line stays, exactly as it did with blanked `.wav` files. Removing
//! that too would be a `ret` at the top of each callback -- a second mode, not
//! a different design.
//!
//! ## Scope, stated plainly
//!
//! Voice **commands** only. Pain, death and hurt sounds are different events
//! and are not touched. Nor is player voice chat (`voice_modenable`) or its
//! `sprites/voiceicon.spr` speaker icon, which belong to `CVoiceStatus` -- a
//! separate system with nothing to do with these callbacks.
