//! `dodtools_ex_interp_max`: raise the engine's interpolation-window ceiling.
//!
//! ## `ex_interp` is engine-managed, which is the whole problem
//!
//! A clamp at `hw+0x18ee0` runs every frame, forces `ex_interp` into a range,
//! and writes the clamped result back through `Cvar_Set` -- printing
//! `ex_interp forced up to %i msec` or `forced down to %i msec` as it goes.
//! Setting the cvar by hand and expecting it to stay does not work, and that is
//! not a DoD quirk: it is the engine.
//!
//! ```text
//!     hw+0x18ef3  mov edi, 0x32          ; floor, 50 ms
//!     hw+0x18ef8  mov ebx, 0x64          ; ceiling, 100 ms  <- this
//!     hw+0x18f5f  mov eax, [0x2d5df84]   ; a flag
//!     hw+0x18f64  test eax, eax
//!     hw+0x18f68  mov ebx, 0xc8          ; ceiling, 200 ms, when it is set
//!     hw+0x18f82  fld [1000.0]
//!     hw+0x18f88  fdiv [cl_updaterate]   ; the real floor, at least 1
//!                 ...clamp into [edi, ebx], print, Cvar_Set it back
//! ```
//!
//! ## The 200 ms path is dead, so this is worth what it looks like
//!
//! #271 asked what the flag at `0x2d5df84` is, and reasoned that if it means
//! "we are playing a demo" then demos already get 200 ms and the work is worth
//! half.
//!
//! They do not. Within `hw.dll` the flag has exactly **four** write sites --
//! every addressing form checked, not just the obvious one:
//!
//! ```text
//!     hw+0x10a58  mov dword [flag], 0        in the demo reader
//!     hw+0x1087a  mov [flag], ebx            in the demo reader, ebx zeroed
//!     hw+0x18537  mov [flag], ebx            in a block zeroing a dozen fields
//!     hw+0x1d791  mov dword [flag], 1        <- unreachable
//! ```
//!
//! The only site that writes 1 has **no caller, no jump to it, no absolute
//! reference anywhere in the image, and no fall-through** -- the instruction
//! before it is an unconditional `jmp`. So the engine never takes the 200 ms
//! branch, the ceiling is a hard 100, and raising it is the only way up.
//!
//! ## And the flag is not the lever to pull
//!
//! Setting it would be one dword and would look tempting. It is read from 25
//! sites, including inside `CL_ParseServerMessage`, the `svc_*` handlers and
//! `CL_CheckCRCs`. Flipping a feature switch the retail build never sets, to
//! find out what else it turns on, is not a thing to do inside someone's
//! capture run. The immediate is the narrow change: it affects the clamp and
//! nothing else.
//!
//! ## What still bounds it
//!
//! `cl_updaterate` sets the floor as `1000 / cl_updaterate`, so a demo recorded
//! at a low update rate cannot be interpolated below what it captured. Raising
//! the ceiling does not make a 20-tick recording smooth; it stops the engine
//! from shortening a window that was already long enough.
//!
//! ## Engine-wide, deliberately
//!
//! `docs/goldsrc_hw_dll_survey.md` sets the standing preference: do it in
//! `client.dll` where an equivalent exists, because an engine change affects
//! the menu and every mod. There is no client-side equivalent here -- the clamp
//! is the engine's -- and this install exists only to render demos.
