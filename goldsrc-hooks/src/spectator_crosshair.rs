//! `dodtools_match_pov_crosshair`: draw the spectator crosshair from the
//! same sprite and the same tile the player's own `cl_xhair_style` picks.
//!
//! ## The two crosshairs are drawn by two different code paths
//!
//! `CHudDoDCrossHair::Draw` branches on the observer-mode global, and the
//! branches do not share a sprite (see `crosshair.rs` for the same fork read
//! from the other side):
//!
//! ```text
//!     mode 0        POV. Reads cl_xhair_style. Non-zero -> client+0x2ced0,
//!                   which draws a 64x64 tile out of customXHair.spr.
//!                   Zero -> client+0x2cda0, the HUD sprite list's crosshair.
//!     mode 3 or 4   client+0x2d1f0. Hardcodes crosshairs.spr and a 24x24
//!                   rect, and reads no cvar at all.
//! ```
//!
//! So a custom crosshair set up for play simply does not appear while
//! spectating, and the spectator one is a 24x24 tile of a 128x128 sprite --
//! which is the "very little to work with" in #291.
//!
//! ## `VidInit` already loaded the sprite
//!
//! Both are loaded unconditionally, into two handles on the same object:
//!
//! ```text
//!     client+0x2cc82  call pfnSPR_Load     ; "sprites/crosshairs.spr"
//!     client+0x2cc88  mov [esi+0x60], eax
//!     client+0x2cca0  call pfnSPR_Load     ; "sprites/customXHair.spr"
//!     client+0x2cca6  mov [esi+0x74], eax
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing needs loading, and no file path is involved. The custom sprite's
//! handle is already sitting at `+0x74`.
//!
//! ## What is patched
//!
//! Five places inside one 57-byte span, `client+0x2d205 .. +0x2d23e`:
//!
//! ```text
//!     +0x2d205  mov dword [ecx+0x64], 0x18   ; left   = 24
//!     +0x2d20c  mov dword [ecx+0x6c], 0      ; top    = 0
//!     +0x2d213  mov dword [ecx+0x68], 0x30   ; right  = 48
//!     +0x2d21a  mov dword [ecx+0x70], 0x18   ; bottom = 24
//!     ...
//!     +0x2d23b  mov eax, [ecx+0x60]          ; <- the sprite handle
//! ```
//!
//! The displacement byte `0x60` becomes `0x74`, and the four rect immediates
//! become the tile `cl_xhair_style` selects. Swapping the handle without the
//! rect would sample a 24x24 corner out of a 256x256 sprite; changing the rect
//! without the handle would sample off the end of a 128x128 one. They are one
//! change, which is why they are one patch.
//!
//! ## The tile arithmetic is DoD's, not ours
//!
//! `client+0x2ced0` -- the POV path, with `cl_xhair_style` in `eax` -- computes
//! its rect like this:
//!
//! ```text
//!     if (style > 16) style = 16;
//!     style--;
//!     col = style % 4;  row = style / 4;
//!     left = col << 6;  right  = (col + 1) << 6;
//!     top  = row << 6;  bottom = (row + 1) << 6;
//! ```
//!
//! A 4x4 grid of 64x64 tiles, which is exactly how the shipped
//! `customXHair.spr` is laid out (256x256, one frame, sixteen crosshairs).
//! [`tile_rect`] reproduces that arithmetic rather than inventing a layout, so
//! the spectator view gets the *same* tile the player sees, whatever they set.
//!
//! ## `cl_xhair_style 0` is not a tile, and is not implemented here
//!
//! The dispatcher at `client+0x2cd5c` checks `style == 0` *before* calling
//! `client+0x2ced0` at all: zero calls `client+0x2cda0` instead, a
//! completely different function that draws the classic four-segment dynamic
//! crosshair (its gap driven by per-frame weapon accuracy fields on the HUD
//! object, and gated by the separate `cl_dynamic_xhair` cvar) rather than
//! blitting a sprite tile. `client+0x2ced0` -- the function this module
//! mirrors -- is never reached for style 0, confirmed by disassembly.
//!
//! Replicating that for a spectated player would mean re-deriving their
//! weapon-accuracy state the same way the animation fix re-derives body
//! animation, and it is not known whether that state is replicated in a demo
//! at all. Out of scope here: this leaves the stock spectator rect in place
//! for style 0 and says so in `dodtools_debug_status` rather than inventing a
//! tile. Filed as a follow-up.
//!
//! ## `cl_xhair_style < 0` draws the whole sheet
//!
//! Unlike the zero case, *every* nonzero style -- negative included -- does
//! reach `client+0x2ced0`, which clamps only at the top (`style > 16` becomes
//! 16) and has no lower clamp at all. For a negative style the resulting
//! `style - 1` feeds a signed mod/div-by-4 that produces rect coordinates
//! outside the sprite. Confirmed live: DoD's own POV view renders that as the
//! entire 256x256 sheet, all sixteen crosshairs at once, rather than clamping
//! or refusing it. [`tile_rect`] reproduces that outcome directly for any
//! negative style, rather than replicating the specific out-of-range
//! arithmetic that happens to produce it.
//!
//! ## It loses to `dodtools_hide_crosshair`
//!
//! That setting stubs `CHudDoDCrossHair::Draw`'s prologue, so neither branch
//! runs and nothing is drawn. Hiding wins by construction, with no interlock
//! needed here: this patches instructions inside a function that is no longer
//! reached. #291 asked for that ordering and this is why it holds.
