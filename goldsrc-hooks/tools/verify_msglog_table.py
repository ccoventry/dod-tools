"""Checks `msglog.rs`'s `MESSAGES` table against a real DoD `client.dll`.

Unlike `deathmsg.rs`/`scoreboard.rs`/etc., `msglog.rs` never patches a byte --
it only hooks and forwards, by name, through addresses it reads out of a
71-entry table that was typed in by hand from a `survey_client_dll.py
messages` run. A transcription slip here would not fail to compile: it would
call some *other* function as if it were the original handler for a message
whose name looks unrelated, and every message that slip touches would either
crash or silently misbehave the first time this DLL is actually loaded. So the
table is diffed against a fresh derivation of the same 71 entries, rather than
trusted.

Usage:
    python goldsrc-hooks/tools/verify_msglog_table.py [path-to-client.dll]

Defaults to the pre-Anniversary movies install. Requires `pefile` and
`capstone` (`pip install pefile capstone`); both are analysis-only and are not
build dependencies of anything in the workspace.
